Veterinarians Utilize the Relief System to Improve Wellbeing?!</h1>Path to Relief<p class="mb-8">Have you always had to plan your life around your work schedule? What happens when an unplanned event comes up? What about when your practice loses a veterinarian?</p><p class="mb-8">Veterinarians are no strangers to those scenarios. My colleagues and I face those situations frequently. We work around it by switching shifts. When that doesn’t work, one of us would take one for the team and fill in for an additional shift. In the current state of veterinary medicine, where veterinarian demand and work-related stress continue to rise, an act of kindness to fill in can potentiate the likelihood of burnout in the long run. There are times when neither options are available, and that’s when we turn to relief doctors.</p><p class="mb-8">I had the opportunity to learn more about the relief field in early 2017 when I received a text that inquired for my availability. Out of curiosity, I agreed to pick up a shift and absolutely enjoyed it. Since then, I pick up shifts whenever my schedule allows. When I had to leave my job due to an unplanned relocation, those experiences enabled me to transition smoothly into working relief while searching for the ideal practice. Little did I know at the time that my experience in the relief market would eventually converge with a long term passion – advocating for wellness in the veterinary profession. I would come to realize that an efficient relief system can play a major role in improving veterinarians’ well-being.</p><p class="mb-8">I enjoy working as a relief doctor for various reasons –</p>Challenges<p class="mb-8">I wondered then, why is it that not more veterinarians pursue relief work? It can’t possibly be due to a poor supply of relief jobs, because I constantly hear about the desperate needs to fill opened positions. Although an adequate supply and demand exist in the relief market, both sides have difficulties to overcome in order to connect with each other.</p><p class="mb-8">Challenges veterinarians face in the relief space –</p><p class="mb-8">Challenges practices face in the relief space –</p><p class="mb-8">In today’s society, there is a technological platform for nearly everything.

A well-integrated relief platform can alleviate that by</p><p class="mb-8">From the practice’s perspective, a comprehensive relief platform can</p>Helping the Relief Platform Come to Life<p class="mb-8">In my effort to improve well-being in the veterinary profession, I decided to make a direct, hospital-to-veterinarian, accessible, and easy to use relief platform a reality. I truly believe that such a platform has considerable potential to revolutionize the whole veterinary industry. During that process, I found a system that shares similar ideals in <!-- -->, founded by Dr. Cindy Trice. After sharing my ideas with her, I found that our passion for the relief space closely aligns with one another. Inspired by Dr. Trice, I began to gear my energy towards helping <!-- --> improve and thrive. For that to happen, we, veterinarians and managers alike, need to believe and participate in this vision:</p><p class="mb-8">As veterinarians, we have become so great at planning our lives around work that it’s difficult to imagine a world that’s the other way around. I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be like this anymore. Professions outside of veterinary medicine have already taken advantage of technological advancement to improve work-life balance. People are finding ways to work remotely and regain control over their schedules. As a profession, I wholeheartedly believe that we can achieve the same.</p>Conclusion<p class="mb-8">Relief in veterinary medicine is commonplace today, but it is still vastly underutilized. Associate veterinarians are still asked to fill in for a shift because the process of finding a relief veterinarian is exhausting and at times unsuccessful. A vicious cycle continues as overworked veterinarians take a much needed vacation, then his or her fellow colleagues need to step up to the plate if relief support is not immediately present. A relief platform like <!-- --> will not single handedly cure burnout or the mental health issue facing the veterinary profession, but it will play a vital role as it allows veterinarians to have more control over their lives in and out of the hospital. At last, we may have a real shot at that elusive “work-life-balance”.</p><p class="mb-8"></p><p class="mb-8"></p></div></div></div><div class="text-center mt-20 mb-8 p-12 relative rounded-lg bg-black bg-opacity-20"><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 -top-14"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27100%27%20height=%27100%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="Andy Chiang, DVM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="align-middle rounded-full" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Andy Chiang, DVM" src="https://media.graphassets.com/tbyUuQqTcqmDPCOa45bs" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" class="align-middle rounded-full" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><h3 class="text-white my-4 text-xl font-bold">Andy Chiang, DVM</h3><p class="text-white text-lg">Dr. Chiang is a relief veterinarian, web developer, and entrepreneur who believes that the mental wellbeing crisis within the veterinary industry can be drastically improved through exploration and collaboration.
